Problem:

 

Well, with the recent merger of the BAA&M Railroad with the Kalamazoo, Erie & Rochester, you find yourself working for the KERBAA&M in a new location.  You are now required to produce very specifically formatted reports for your new hot-tempered management. 

 

The data file should have the following information (Each item is on a separate line):

Name of Railroad

Destination

Number of ore cars

Current price of Coal per short ton.

 

You need to calculate:

1. the amount of coal,

2. the total value of the shipment, and

3. the surcharge. 

 

Assume that every car holds 74.5 tons.  The surcharge is set at 0.31% of the total value of the shipment.

You need to produce a report formatted EXACTLY as follows (with your name):

 

KERBAA & M COAL TRAIN REPORT â€“ <YOUR NAME>

 

Railroad Name:    Ironton and Tylerville

Destination:      Flint Edison #4

 

Number of ore cars:............          87

Total weight of coal...........     6481.50 short tons

Current Cost per short ton..... $     65.47

Total Value of Shipment........ $ 424343.81

Current Surcharge..............        0.31%

 

Total Surcharge(Est)........... $   1315.47



 

You must run your program from a file containing the following data:

Ironton and Tylerville

Flint Edison #4

87

65.47

Your assignment is to calculate the monthly bill for a cell phone user given the following rate structure. Note that this is a simpler structure than in real life â€“ you do NOT have to be concerned about whether it is a weekday or a weekend, just whether the call is made during the day or the night.

 

All evening and night calls that begin from 6pm (exactly) up to and including 5:59am are free and there is no limit on these minutes used. As long as the call starts before 6am (even if it lasts until after 6am) it is counted as a night time call.
The basic monthly rate is $39.99 which includes the first 200 minutes of daytime calls (from 6am up to and including 5:59pm).  These can be within the calling area or long distance. If a call begins before 6pm and lasts until after 6pm, the entire call is treated as a daytime call.
As soon as the 200 minutes have been used, there is a charge for daytime calls at the rate of $0.29 per minute if the call is within the area, or $0.69 per minute for long distance. For the one call that begins before the 200 minutes have been used but lasts until over the 200 minutes, only the portion over the 200 minutes is charged.  All subsequent daytime calls are charged for the entire duration of the call.  Again, if a call begins in the daytime period and is subject to charge, the entire duration is chargeable (as above).
                            

Your task is to read in a series of calls, calculate the cost of each call (if any), and find the total bill for the month. More specifically, your program must read in a series of phone calls from a data file that you have to make for yourself.  This data is arranged with the information about each call on a separate line.

 

1100    30        L

2230    20        A

1200    100      A

559      40        L

1530    60        L

800      15        A

1800    20        L

600      10        A

1730    10        L

1759    5          A

1          3          A

 

This information is:

The time of day that the call started (using an int to represent a 24 hour clock).

The duration of the call in minutes (int), and

A char for the type of call - A for a call within the area, L for a long-distance call.

 

For example, the line

1830    20        A

means that the call started at 6:30pm, lasted for 20 minutes and was within the calling area.

You may assume that there will be no bad data given. Note also that for times before 10am, there are no leading zeros. (C++ treats integers with leading zeros as octal values).

 

SUGGESTION

You should design, compile, run and debug your program in stages. 

You might start by testing if your program can just read and echo the data file. 
After this is working accurately, write the code to determine whether the call is a day or night one. 
Finally, add the code to determine whether the call will incur a charge, how many minutes will be charged, the cost of the call and the total bill for the month.
 

Remember to use good style with consistent indentation, plenty of comments, good variable names etc. and don't forget to echo the data as it is read.  The output must be clear and readable with appropriate string constants and spacing.

 

Make sure you always submit(upload) the .cpp file(s) and the output file(s) or a screen shot of the output.
